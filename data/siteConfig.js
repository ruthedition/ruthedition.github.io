  authorDescription: `After spending a few years trying to find something that can keep me interested and become a lasting career,
  I found my self completing a Software Engineering bootcamp, while being a stay-at-home mom to a one year old...in the middle of
  a pandemic... All I can say is, it was interesting. In the last 10 months, my time at Flatiron School 
  has given me the ability to be adaptable to unexpected changes and find flexibility not only in my life, but in the 
  way I interact with code.`,
